# The Pure Love of Christ ❤️

## Overview

The idea behind my web application **"The Pure Love of Christ"** is based on the need we have, as disciples of Jesus Christ, to serve others. The application is inspired by the words of the prophet Moroni:

> “Moroni 7:47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.”

With this application, users will receive randomly generated challenges that will help the users spread and receive Christ’s pure love. Additionally, these challenges will strengthen the bonds that unite us with our family, friends, neighbors, and church community, making charity an essential part of our daily lives.

## Target Audience

This application is intended for individuals who strive to be like Jesus Christ and have the desire to serve, strengthen bonds of unity with others, and to follow the path of discipleship:

> “John 13:35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”
